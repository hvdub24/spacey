## Inspiration
One night, long, long minutes ago, we were just messing around on google looking at memes. And we came across a video about Elon Musk posted on one of the most intellectual youtube channels, Saturday Night Live.

It was enlightening. We immediately figured out that the famous, genius, multi-billionaire, philanthropist, eccentric was hiding a secret project called Space-Y.

## What it does
While everyone is led to believe that Space-X is his major project, Elon actually has a secret project called Space-Y which aims to detect and display the closest Near-Earth Orbiting object and set up micro colonies there before he steps foot on Mars.

## How we built it
Space-Y uses NASA's Asteroids Near Earth Object Web Service API to get data on the closest approaching asteroid toward Earth and detect if it will be potentially hazardous (if it isn't, we can inhabit it. if not, we'll be staying there eventually, in pieces).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We managed to create many website elements using HTML and CSS and integrate them with the JavaScript backend. We have never worked with APIs and creating graphics using CSS, which we are very proud of accomplishing.
